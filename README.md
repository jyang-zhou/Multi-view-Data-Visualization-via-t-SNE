# Multi-view Data Visualization via t-SNE

mSNE and multi-SNE are implemented on different types of data, where mSne and multi-SNE are two different methods to visualize multi-view data. 

Please see sample code for more detail.

# Data Description
Handwritten Digits [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Multiple+Features]: Consists of features on handwritten numerals (0 - 9) extracted from a collection of Dutch
utility maps. 200 patterns per class (for a total of 2000 patterns) have been digitised in binary images. These digits
are represented in terms of six data-views: (a) Fourier coefficients of the character shapes (76 features), (b) profile
correlations (216), (c) Karhunen-Love coefficients (64), (d) pixel averages in 2 x 3 windows (240), (e) Zernike
moments (47 ) and (f) morphological features (6) Dua and Graff [2017].

Caltech7 [https://github.com/yeqinglee/mvdata]: Caltech-101 contains pictures of objects belonging to 101 categories. This subset of Caltech-101 contains
only 7 classes and it was created because of the imbalanced number of objects in each class of Caltech-101. It consists
of 1474 objects on six data-views: (a) Gabor (48 features), (b) wavelet moments (40), (c) CENTRIST (254), (d)
histogram of oriented gradients (1984), (e) GIST (512), and (f) local binary patterns (928 ) Fei-Fei et al. [2006] .
